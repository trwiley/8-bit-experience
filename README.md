# INFO-I 310 Honors Project

My project as a part of an honors conversion of INFO-I 310, Multimedia Arts and Technology, at Indiana University South Bend. This is a work in process, but
here are my current ideas for this project:

* Audio portion: music loop, overlaid with various percussive sounds that can
be cued with either in-patch controls or an external MIDI device. Sounds sourced from either freesound.org or generated by myself.

* Visual portion: series of four or five video clips and .gifs, all created 
by myself. Visual effects will be triggered by the filtering. Maybe crossfaded with webcam footage.

## ARTISTIC CONCEPT

I'm going for a vaguely 8-bit computer aesthetic here, hence the name. Expect lots of rubber ducks.
